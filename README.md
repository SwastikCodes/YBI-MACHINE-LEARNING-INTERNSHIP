# YBI-MACHINE-LEARNING-INTERNSHIP
I have created this model which predicts the compressive strength of cement based on various parameters like quantity of cement, water, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate,etc.
I have created it as a final project for my internship in machine learning at YBI foundation.
